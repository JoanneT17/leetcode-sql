-- Table: Students

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | student_id    | int     |
-- | student_name  | varchar |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- student_id is the primary key for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains the ID and the name of one student in the school.
 

-- Table: Subjects

-- +--------------+---------+
-- | Column Name  | Type    |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- | subject_name | varchar |

-- Table: Examinations

-- +--------------+---------+
-- | Column Name  | Type    |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- | student_id   | int     |
-- | subject_name | varchar |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
-- Each student from the Students table takes every course from Subjects table.
-- Each row of this table indicates that a student with ID student_id attended the exam of subject_name.
 

-- Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

-- Order the result table by student_id and subject_name.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Students table:
-- +------------+--------------+
-- | student_id | student_name |
-- +------------+--------------+
-- | 1          | Alice        |
